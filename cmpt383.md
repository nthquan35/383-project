# My project ideas:
## The project idea is evaluating AI algorithms or Big Data/Machine Learning Analysis.
- The analysis part will run on **Python3**. 
- display the results on front-end web page using **JavaScript** frameworks.
- run back-end system on **Golang** frameworks.

* Importing **os/exec** load external **Python3** files into **Golang**. 
* The front-end page uses **RESTful API** to communicate with the Golang web server through HTTP protocol. 

**Docker containers** is being used as deployment technology to test on each programming languages independently.
